## infrastructure Layer in DDD

- The infrastructure layer manages the system-to-system interactions, stores data that is external to the system and caters to requests for data retrieval received from the other layers such as the business layer. The infrastructure layer is a technology and platform-independent layer.

## Domain Layer in DDD

- There all the business and applications rules are laid down and will be controlling the processing of information independently from the infrastructure and frameworks.
